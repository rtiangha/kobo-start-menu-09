<p><b>x_wget_*.sh</b> are (almost useless) examples of how to display internet content without browser. All these scripts, with the exception of x_wget_httpbin.org.sh and (at least of the time of writing) x_wget_w1.weather.gov.sh, try to access web pages that use the https protocl and are therefore not accessible with the onboard wget. To make these scripts work you have to install an external wget. Cf. /.adds/wget/info.txt</p>
