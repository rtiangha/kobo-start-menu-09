<ul>Warning:
 <li>Do not install an update package when the battery charge is low.</li>
 <li>KSM does not check whether there is sufficent free disk space for the update. If you have some doubts, do not install the package.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li><b>KR/K install uncontrolled:</b> This will install the complete Kobo update package that is available in .kobo. Depending on the content of the update package, this might disable KSM.</li>
 <li><b>KR/K install controlled:</b> This will install the Kobo update package that is available in .kobo, with the exception of those parts that are likely to disable KSM.</li>
 <li>Rule of thumb:
   <ul>
     <li>Use <b>KR install controlled</b> for Kobo firmware update files.</li>
     <li>Use <b>KR install uncontrolled</b> for patch packages by GeoffR, and packages specifically provided for KSM.</li>
   </ul>
</li> 
<li>If you are unsure what to do, select: "give a recommendation." Depending on the size of the update package, this might need some minutes. No reason to get worried.</li>
